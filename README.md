# Surfs_Up 
## Overview 
The purpose of this analysis is to extract the temperature from the months of June and December from the hawaii.sqlite dataset. On top of extracting the temperature from the dataset we then want to find the summary statistics of the temperatures from those two months. A tangible purpose of this analysis could range from vacation planning, surf forecasting, or research purposes.  
## Results 
* The June average temperature is higher than the December average temperature, but only by 3 degrees. 
* June has higher temperature quartiles when compared to December 
* There is a significant difference between minimum temperatures between the two months whereas their max temperatures are roughly the same 
## Summary 
According to the data shown, June temperatures are generally hotter than December temperatures which is to be expected. Generally during the summertime which is June, July, and August we see increased average temperatures and during the winter times we see decreased temperatures. However, it is a bit shocking to see how little the difference is between June and December temperatures. Furthermore, we can also look at precipiation rates and see that December generally has higher rates of precipitation, but also has higher variance between the days when compared to June. December's 'prcp' standard deviation is 0.54 while June's 'prcp' standard deviation is 0.34. The two queries that performed the extracting of the 'prcp' data is in the jupyter notebook.
